			Tryfan has given me some great ideas about what I can incorporate into my website to ensure I engage the ideal target audience and make it interactive and easy to follow.

				<h2> Custom Designs </h2>
				<p> I can highlight and display <b>your</b> businesses personality to appeal to potential customers. 
				A bright cheerful website to bring families to your Cafe, or something more formal for your restaurant?
				All my designs are optimised for both mobile and desktop devices to be accessible and appealing to the widest possible audience. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div class = 'feature'>
				<h2> Cost Effective </h2>
				<p> Using real code, lets me avoid subscription services to the extent that I can set up websites that cost nothing to run (like this one).
					The cost of traditional advertising or a DIY website with drag and drop website builder, hosting and domain name can easily exceed my upfront cost within months.
					However, some features will need an ongoing subscription. </p>

				<h2> Saves You Time </h2>
				<p> As a business owner, your time is valuable, so I make sure to make the process easy and fast for you.
				I am skilled in the full range of tasks needed to create a high quality website. This saves you the effort of finding all the professionals you need. 
				I can work with minimal input, but you are very welcome to be part of the process. </p>
